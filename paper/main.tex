\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This paper investigates the causal effect of generative AI availability on employment at the occupation level using comprehensive U.S. labor market data. Using a difference-in-differences (DiD) design, we compare employment trends in high AI-exposure occupations against low-exposure occupations before and after the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Our panel dataset comprises 3,051,972 complete observations spanning 696 occupations, 54 states, and 511 industries from 2015 to 2024. We measure AI exposure using validated scores from ILO (2025), complemented by teleworkability (Dingel \& Neiman 2020) and pre-AI automation risk (Frey \& Osborne 2017) measures. Preliminary results suggest [INSERT MAIN FINDING: direction and magnitude of the treatment effect]. These findings contribute to the growing literature on AI's labor market impacts and have implications for policymakers considering workforce transition programs. We discuss the parallel trends assumption, conduct robustness checks, and acknowledge limitations including the 42.93\% data retention rate from complete-case analysis.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked a watershed moment in the deployment of artificial intelligence technologies. Unlike previous waves of automation that primarily affected routine manual and cognitive tasks, generative AI systems demonstrate capabilities in non-routine cognitive work, including writing, coding, analysis, and creative tasks \citep{eloundou2023gpts}. This technological shift raises fundamental questions about the future of employment across diverse sectors of the economy.

% Causal Question
\textbf{Causal Question:} What is the causal effect of the availability of Generative AI on employment rates in the United States for occupations with varying degrees of exposure to Generative AI?

% Context
The context for this analysis is the U.S. labor market from 2015 to 2024, encompassing a pre-treatment period of relative AI stability (2015-2022) and a post-treatment period following the widespread availability of large language models (2023-2024). The treatment event—the public release of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022—provides a clear temporal discontinuity that separates these periods. Our analysis uses occupation-level data across all U.S. states and industries.

% Importance
Understanding AI's employment effects is crucial for several reasons. First, policymakers need evidence-based guidance to design workforce transition programs and social safety nets. Second, firms require insights into how AI adoption might reshape their labor force composition. Third, workers benefit from understanding which skills and occupations face disruption versus complementarity with AI systems. The stakes are substantial: the International Labour Organization estimates that generative AI could affect the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs globally \citep{gmyrek2023generative}.

% Hypothesis
Based on the theoretical framework of task-based automation \citep{acemoglu2011skills} and recent empirical studies on AI exposure \citep{felten2021occupational}, we hypothesize that industries with higher occupational exposure to generative AI will experience differential employment trends following AI availability. The direction of this effect is theoretically ambiguous: the displacement effect suggests reduced employment as AI substitutes for human labor, while the productivity effect suggests potential employment gains as AI complements human workers and creates new tasks. Our prior expectation, informed by historical patterns of automation \citep{autor2015there}, is that any negative employment effects will be modest in magnitude in the short run, with heterogeneous impacts across occupations within industries.

% Approach Summary
To address this causal question, we employ a difference-in-differences (DiD) research design at the occupation level. We compare employment trends in high AI-exposure occupations (top 33\%, based on the 67th percentile threshold) against low AI-exposure occupations before and after November 2022. Our analysis leverages annual occupation-level employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics covering 696 occupations with complete exposure data across 54 states and 511 industries. Occupation-level AI exposure scores are derived from ILO Working Paper 140 (2025) \citep{gmyrek2023generative}, complemented by teleworkability scores from \cite{dingel2020many} and automation risk scores from \cite{frey2017future}.

% Paper Structure
The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section \ref{sec:literature} reviews the relevant literature on AI and employment. Section \ref{sec:data} describes our data sources and key variables. Section \ref{sec:methodology} presents our causal identification strategy and econometric specifications. Section \ref{sec:results} reports our main findings and robustness checks. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} discusses implications and concludes. Section \ref{sec:limitations} acknowledges the limitations of our study.

% 2. LITERATURE REVIEW
%--------------------------------------
\section{Literature Review}\label{sec:literature}

\subsection{Theoretical Frameworks for AI and Employment}

The economic literature on automation and employment has evolved from early concerns about ``technological unemployment'' \citep{keynes1930economic} to more nuanced task-based frameworks \citep{autor2003skill, acemoglu2018race}. The canonical model distinguishes between the \textit{displacement effect}, where automation substitutes for human labor in existing tasks, and the \textit{productivity effect}, where automation complements human workers and creates new tasks \citep{acemoglu2019automation}.

Generative AI represents a qualitative shift in automation capabilities. While previous technologies primarily automated routine tasks—whether manual (assembly line) or cognitive (data entry)—large language models demonstrate proficiency in non-routine cognitive tasks traditionally considered resistant to automation \citep{brynjolfsson2023generative}. This has led researchers to reconsider which occupations face exposure to AI-driven automation.

\subsection{Measuring AI Exposure}

Several methodologies have emerged for quantifying occupational and industry exposure to AI. \cite{felten2021occupational} developed the AI Occupational Exposure (AIOE) measure based on the overlap between AI application capabilities and occupational task requirements. \cite{webb2020impact} used patent text analysis to identify which occupations are most exposed to AI technologies. Most relevant to our study, \cite{gmyrek2023generative} created exposure scores specifically for generative AI based on GPT-4's ability to perform occupation-specific tasks, finding that approximately 5.5\% of total employment is in occupations highly exposed to automation by generative AI.

\subsection{Empirical Evidence on AI's Employment Effects}

Empirical evidence on AI's labor market impacts remains nascent. \cite{acemoglu2022artificial} find that firms adopting AI reduced hiring for affected occupations, though productivity gains partially offset employment losses. \cite{noy2023experimental} document substantial productivity improvements for professional writing tasks using ChatGPT, suggesting complementarity between AI and certain cognitive skills.

Studies specifically examining generative AI's employment effects are emerging. \cite{hui2023ai} find that freelance platform earnings for AI-exposed occupations (writing, coding) declined following ChatGPT's release. \cite{eisfeldt2023generative} estimate that firms with higher AI exposure experienced differential stock market performance, suggesting market expectations of productivity effects.

\subsection{Contribution to Literature}

Our study contributes to this literature in several ways. First, we provide causal estimates of generative AI's employment effects using a quasi-experimental design, addressing the endogeneity concerns in cross-sectional studies. Second, we analyze industry-level effects using comprehensive BLS data, complementing occupation-level studies that may miss between-occupation reallocation effects. Third, we examine the medium-run (2023-2025) effects, providing evidence beyond the immediate post-release period.

% 3. DATA
%--------------------------------------
\section{Data}\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Data Sources}

Our analysis combines data from multiple sources:\footnote{All data and code for this project are available at: \url{https://github.com/[USERNAME]/AI_Effects_On_Labour_Market}. The variable codebook is provided in Appendix \ref{app:codebook}.}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
    \item \textbf{Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS):} Annual employment data by occupation, state, and industry from 2015 to 2024.
    \item \textbf{ILO Working Paper 140 (2025) \citep{gmyrek2023generative}:} Occupation-level generative AI exposure scores based on GPT-4 task automation assessments, mapped from ISCO-08 to SOC 2018.
    \item \textbf{Dingel \& Neiman (2020) \citep{dingel2020many}:} Occupation-level teleworkability scores based on O*NET work context data.
    \item \textbf{Frey \& Osborne (2017) \citep{frey2017future}:} Occupation-level pre-AI automation risk scores (702 occupations) from traditional computerization probability estimates.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Treatment and Outcome Variables}

\textbf{Treatment:} The treatment is the availability of generative AI, operationalized as the interaction between occupation-level AI exposure and a post-treatment indicator. We define:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Post_t = 1$ if $t \geq$ 2023, and 0 otherwise. ChatGPT was released November 30, 2022; we use 2023 as the first full year of availability.
    \item $HighExposure_o = 1$ if occupation $o$ has an AI exposure score $\geq$ 67th percentile threshold, and 0 otherwise. This classifies the top 33\% of occupations as high-exposure.
    \item $Treat_{ot} = HighExposure_o \times Post_t$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Outcome:} The primary outcome is the natural log of annual employment ($\ln(Employment_{osit})$) for occupation $o$ in state $s$, industry $i$, at year $t$. The log transformation allows us to interpret coefficients as approximate percentage changes.

\subsection{Occupation-Level Data and Complete Cases}

Our analysis uses occupation-level data with complete exposure scores. Table \ref{tab:data_summary} presents key dataset characteristics.

\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

\subsection{Summary Statistics}

Table \ref{tab:summary_stats} presents summary statistics for the key variables in our analysis.

\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

\subsection{Data Limitations}

Several limitations of our data merit discussion:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Complete-case selection:} Our analysis uses only observations with complete exposure data (42.93\% of original dataset), which may introduce selection bias if data availability correlates with occupation characteristics.
    
    \item \textbf{Measurement of AI exposure:} Our exposure classification relies on ex-ante assessments of AI's task-level capabilities, which may not perfectly correspond to actual AI adoption rates across occupations.
    
    \item \textbf{Annual frequency:} Employment data at annual frequency may miss short-term dynamics and seasonal patterns in AI's employment effects.
    
    \item \textbf{Missing variables:} SkillIntensity and RoutineTaskIndex excluded from analysis due to insufficient data coverage, potentially omitting relevant heterogeneity dimensions.
\end{enumerate}

% 4. METHODOLOGY
%--------------------------------------
\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}

\subsection{Why Simple Regression is Insufficient}

A naive approach to estimating AI's employment effect would regress employment on a measure of AI adoption or exposure:
\begin{equation}
    \ln(Employment_i) = \alpha + \beta \cdot AIExposure_i + \varepsilon_i
\end{equation}

This approach suffers from confounding bias. Industries with high AI exposure differ systematically from low-exposure industries in ways that independently affect employment. For example, high AI-exposure industries tend to be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item More skill-intensive (requiring higher education)
    \item More teleworkable
    \item Less exposed to pre-AI automation
    \item Subject to different demand trends (e.g., secular growth in tech-related services)
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:dag} presents a directed acyclic graph (DAG) illustrating these confounding relationships.

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{fig:dag}
\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
\small\textit{Notes:} The dashed red arrow represents the backdoor path from AI Exposure to Employment through unobserved confounders. The parameter of interest ($\beta$) is the causal effect of AI availability on employment.
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Difference-in-Differences Design}

To address confounding, we employ a difference-in-differences (DiD) design that exploits:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cross-sectional variation:} Industries differ in their exposure to generative AI.
    \item \textbf{Temporal variation:} ChatGPT's release in November 2022 provides a clear treatment timing.
\end{enumerate}

The key identifying assumption is \textbf{parallel trends}: in the absence of treatment, high and low AI-exposure industries would have followed parallel employment trends.

\subsection{Econometric Specifications}

Our baseline specification is:
\begin{equation}
    \ln(Employment_{osit}) = \beta_1 \cdot Treat_{ot} + \alpha_o + \gamma_t + \delta_s + \theta_i + \varepsilon_{osit}
    \label{eq:baseline}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\ln(Employment_{osit})$ is log employment for occupation $o$, state $s$, industry $i$, at year $t$
    \item $Treat_{ot} = HighExposure_o \times Post_t$ is the treatment indicator
    \item $\alpha_o$ are occupation fixed effects (absorb time-invariant occupation characteristics)
    \item $\gamma_t$ are year fixed effects (absorb economy-wide shocks)
    \item $\delta_s$ are state fixed effects (absorb time-invariant state characteristics)
    \item $\theta_i$ are industry fixed effects (absorb industry-specific trends)
    \item $\varepsilon_{osit}$ is the error term
\end{itemize}

The coefficient of interest is $\beta_1$, which estimates the \textbf{average treatment effect on the treated (ATT)}—the differential change in log employment for high AI-exposure occupations relative to low-exposure occupations after ChatGPT's release.

\textbf{Alternative specification with continuous treatment:}
\begin{equation}
    \ln(Employment_{osit}) = \beta_1 \cdot (AIScore_o \times Post_t) + \alpha_o + \gamma_t + \delta_s + \theta_i + \varepsilon_{osit}
    \label{eq:continuous}
\end{equation}

This specification uses the continuous AI exposure score instead of the binary classification, capturing heterogeneous effects by exposure intensity.

\textbf{Event study specification:}
\begin{equation}
    \ln(Employment_{osit}) = \sum_{k=-K}^{K} \beta_k \cdot (HighExposure_o \times \mathbf{1}[Year = 2023+k]) + \alpha_o + \gamma_t + \delta_s + \theta_i + \varepsilon_{osit}
    \label{eq:eventstudy}
\end{equation}

This specification includes leads and lags relative to the treatment year (2023), allowing us to: (1) test the parallel trends assumption by examining pre-treatment coefficients, and (2) trace out the dynamic effects of AI availability.

\subsection{Identifying Assumptions}

The DiD estimator requires the following assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Parallel trends:} Absent the treatment, high and low AI-exposure industries would have followed parallel employment trends. We assess this assumption by:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Visual inspection of pre-treatment trends
        \item Event study coefficients for pre-treatment periods
        \item Placebo tests using alternative treatment dates
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{No anticipation:} Employment in high-exposure industries did not change in anticipation of AI availability before November 2022. This assumption may be violated if firms began adjusting hiring practices based on anticipated AI capabilities.
    
    \item \textbf{Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA):} The treatment effect on one industry does not depend on the treatment status of other industries. This may be violated if there are spillovers (e.g., workers displaced from high-exposure industries move to low-exposure industries).
    
    \item \textbf{No compositional changes:} The composition of industries remains stable over the sample period. Significant entry/exit of firms could bias estimates.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Standard Error Estimation}

We cluster standard errors at the occupation level to account for serial correlation in employment within occupations over time \citep{bertrand2004much}. This accounts for the fact that shocks to specific occupations may be correlated across states and industries. We also report results with alternative clustering (state level, two-way clustering at occupation × year) as robustness checks.

\textbf{Interpretation:} The coefficient in Column (3) (preferred specification) of [X.XXX] indicates that following ChatGPT's release, employment in high AI-exposure occupations (top 33\%) [increased/decreased] by approximately [X.X]\% relative to low AI-exposure occupations, controlling for occupation, year, state, and industry fixed effects. This effect is [statistically significant/not statistically significant] at the [X]\% level.

\subsection{Event Study Results}

Figure \ref{fig:event_study} presents event study estimates showing the dynamic effects of AI availability on employment.

The reference period is 2022 (t = -1). Shaded area indicates 95\% confidence intervals. Standard errors are clustered at the occupation level. Generated by \texttt{did\_analysis\_complete.R}.
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The pre-treatment coefficients [are/are not] statistically distinguishable from zero, [supporting/casting doubt on] the parallel trends assumption. Post-treatment coefficients (2023-2024) show [describe dynamic pattern]. With only 2 post-treatment years, we observe [immediate/gradual/delayed] effects.

\subsection{Robustness Checks}

\subsubsection{Alternative Treatment Thresholds}

Table \ref{tab:robustness} Column (1) presents results using the 75th percentile threshold (top 25\% as high-exposure) instead of 67th percentile.

\subsubsection{Continuous Treatment}

Column (2) uses a continuous AI exposure measure instead of the binary classification, estimating heterogeneous effects by exposure intensity.

\subsection{Statistical and Practical Significance}

\textbf{Statistical significance:} The main treatment effect is [statistically significant/not statistically significant] at conventional levels (p-value = X.XXX). The 95\% confidence interval is [X.XXX, X.XXX], which [does/does not] include zero.

\textbf{Practical significance:} To assess the economic magnitude of our findings, we calculate Cohen's $d$:
\begin{equation}
    d = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1}{\sigma_{pooled}} = \frac{X.XXX}{X.XXX} = X.XX
\end{equation}

According to Cohen's conventions, $d = 0.2$ is considered small, $d = 0.5$ medium, and $d = 0.8$ large. Our effect size of [X.XX] suggests a [small/medium/large] practical effect.

In substantive terms, the point estimate implies that generative AI availability is associated with approximately [X,XXX] [more/fewer] jobs in high-exposure occupations (those in the top 33\% of AI exposure) over the post-treatment period, equivalent to [X.X]\% of baseline employment in these occupations. Given our sample includes 696 occupations across 54 states and 511 industries, this represents substantial employment effects.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper provides causal evidence on the employment effects of generative AI availability in the United States using occupation-level data. Using a difference-in-differences design that compares employment trends in high versus low AI-exposure occupations (based on the 67th percentile threshold) before and after ChatGPT's release, we find that [MAIN FINDING].

\textbf{Summary of findings:} The coefficient on the treatment variable indicates that high AI-exposure occupations (top 33\%) experienced a [X.X percentage point] [increase/decrease] in employment relative to low-exposure occupations following generative AI availability. Our analysis uses a complete-cases dataset (42.93\% retention, 3.05 million observations) covering 696 occupations with validated exposure scores from peer-reviewed sources. The effect is [statistically significant/not significant] and represents a [small/medium/large] effect size by conventional standards.

\textbf{Policy implications:} Our findings have several implications for policymakers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [First implication related to workforce transition programs]
    \item [Second implication related to education and training]
    \item [Third implication related to industry-specific policies]
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Future research:} Several avenues merit further investigation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Heterogeneity analysis by teleworkability and automation risk dimensions
    \item Longer-run effects as AI adoption matures beyond 2024
    \item Analysis of job quality, wages, and hours alongside employment levels
    \item Cross-country comparisons using comparable occupation-level data
    \item Integration of SkillIntensity and RoutineTaskIndex once data coverage improves
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations}\label{sec:limitations}

We acknowledge several limitations of our analysis:

\subsection{Data Limitations}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Complete-case selection:} Our analysis uses only 42.93\% of the original data (observations with complete exposure scores). While we retain 100\% of states and 93\% of industries, only 38\% of occupations have complete data. This may bias results if data availability correlates with occupation characteristics relevant to AI effects.
    
    \item \textbf{AI exposure measurement:} Our occupation-level AI exposure scores are based on ex-ante assessments of AI capabilities rather than actual adoption rates. Occupations classified as high-exposure may vary in their actual AI uptake.
    
    \item \textbf{Temporal coverage:} Our post-treatment period (2023-2024) captures only the initial 2 years following widespread AI availability. Longer-run effects may differ substantially as adoption deepens.
    
    \item \textbf{Missing variables:} SkillIntensity and RoutineTaskIndex are excluded due to insufficient coverage. These variables could reveal important heterogeneity in AI effects.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Identification Concerns}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Parallel trends:} The pre-treatment period (2015-2022) spans 8 years, but annual frequency limits our ability to detect subtle trend violations. The assumption is testable through event study specifications.
    
    \item \textbf{Anticipation effects:} Firms may have adjusted employment practices in anticipation of AI capabilities before ChatGPT's public release, given prior awareness of large language model development. This would attenuate our estimates.
    
    \item \textbf{Spillovers:} Workers displaced from high-exposure occupations may relocate to low-exposure occupations, potentially biasing our estimates. Occupation fixed effects partially address this by absorbing time-invariant occupation characteristics.
    
    \item \textbf{Multiple treatments:} Other technological and economic changes occurred during the post-treatment period. Our occupation-level analysis with multiple fixed effects helps isolate AI-specific effects.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{External Validity}

Our findings pertain to U.S. occupations from 2015-2024, representing 42.93\% of all occupation-state-industry-year combinations (complete-case analysis). Generalizability to other contexts may be limited by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Excluded occupations (61.6\% without complete data): Results may not apply to emerging occupations or those without historical data
    \item Other countries: Differences in labor market institutions, AI adoption rates, and workforce skill distributions
    \item Short post-treatment period: Effects beyond 2024 may differ as AI adoption matures
    \item Occupation-level focus: Cannot capture firm-level or worker-level heterogeneity in AI adoption
\end{itemize}
