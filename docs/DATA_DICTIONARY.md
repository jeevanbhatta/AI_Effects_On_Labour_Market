## Panel Structure

**Dimensions:** State × Industry × Occupation × Year

- States: 54
- Industries: 511
- Occupations: 1004
- Years: 10
- **Theoretical max observations:** 54 × 511 × 1004 × 10 = 277,043,760
- **Actual observations:** 7,108,826 (2.6% of theoretical max)

**Note:** Missing observations are due to:
- BLS suppression of cells with small employment counts
- Occupation-industry combinations that do not exist
- Data quality filters applied during processing
